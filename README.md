The purpose of the app is to show the current sphere's recommended pal level so you can be more efficient with your spheres without needing to memorize anything.

> [!NOTE]
> Run Palworld in Borderless mode or the Overlay won't work!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you start the programm before Palworld, it is likely that the overlay's position won't be where it was intented to be.

In case you are not a fan of EXEs and want to run it from the Python script itself, here is a list of the dependencies you will need:
```
pip install pyautogui psutil pywinauto pynput pystray pillow
```
You will need the icon.ico in the same folder if you are working with the python file unless manually removed.
